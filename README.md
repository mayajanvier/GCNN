# GCNN

Implementation of [Group Equivariant Convolutional Network (T.S. Cohen, M. Wellin, 2016] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576), using PyTorch. 

## Rotated MNIST 
Implementation of the rotated dataset, baseline Z2CNN, P4CNN with and without dropout, P4MCNN as an addition to original paper. 
Training routine taken from [Adam Bielski implementation] (https://github.com/adambielski/pytorch-gconv-experiments)
